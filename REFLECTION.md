1. Were my predicitons correct?: Some of my predictions were correct, like predicting that Wednesday would have the most screen time as well having the best focus. But, I predicted that more caffeine wouldn't help my focus and it was wrong. The days with higher caffeine intake showed a slight increase in focus levels which turned out that my prediction was wrong.

2. What surprised me?: Something that surprised me was how much caffeine really correlated with my focus. I actually thought I focused better with less caffeine, but the data showed I was often more focused on days when I drank more coffee.

3. What was tricky or rewarding? the trickiest part was setting up the functions to process all the objects in the array correctly without accidentally skipping or miscounting data. It was cool to see the printed analysis match my actual week and to get insights I didn’t expect.

4. How did using my own data change things? Using my own data made this project feel a lot more engaging and meaningful. It wasn’t just abstract numbers but it was also about my real habits. This did made me more motivated to finish the assignment and actually learn from it.
